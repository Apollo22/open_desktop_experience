# Open Desktop Experience

This repository aims to describe ways we could be interacting with our computers (desktop and laptop), both through the desktop environment and through specific softwares. To be specific, the goal here is to be exhaustive on all interactions paradigms, and to list all the functions that should be implemented.

In the end we believe this could be used by developers as a checklist of interactions to include for a specific program.

Due to the descriptive nature of this work, it is necessary to use technical description (i.e. words and expressions) that may not exist today, or that may be inacurate. To act on this issue, you should see technical words or expressions should be in __bold__ and linked to their description in the [__dictionnary file__](./dictionnary.md "Dictionnary file"). It might happen that we redefine some technical words or expressions we think are innacurate (though we will try to only rename what they encompass to limit confusion).

The repository contains __4 folders__ :
  
  - [__desktop environments__] (./desktop_environments "Desktop Environmnents folder") : describes possible interactions with the __desktop environment__
  - [__GUI Softwares__] (./gui_softwares "GUI Softwares folder") : describes possible interactions for a given program type with a __GUI__
  - [__CLI Softwares__] (./cli_softwares "CLI Softwares folder") : describes possible interactions for a given program type with a __CLI__
  - [__computer hardware__] (./computer_hardware "Computer Hardware folder") : describes possible interactions with computer hardware
  
It also contains __1 file__ :
  
  - [__dictionnary.md__](./dictionnary.md "Dictionnary file") : describes technical words of expressions
 
 NB: I am currently alone on this project, and I am a native french speaker, so don't hesitate if you spot errors.
