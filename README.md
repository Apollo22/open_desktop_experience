# Open Desktop Experience

This repository aims to describe ways we could be interacting with our computers (desktop and laptop), both through the desktop environment and through specific softwares. To be specific, the goal here is to be exhaustive on all interactions paradigms, and to list all the functions that should be implemented.

In the end we believe this could be used by developers as a checklist of interactions to include for a specific program.

Due to the descriptive nature of this work, it is necessary to use technical description (i.e. words and expressions) that may not exist today, or that may be inacurate. To act on this issue, you should see technical words or expressions should be in __bold__ and linked to their description in the [__dictionnary folder__](../dictionnary "Dictionnary Folder"). 

The repository contains 4 folders :
  - __desktop environment__ : describes possible interactions with the __desktop environment__
  - __GUI Softwares__ : describes possible interactions for a given program type with a __GUI__
  - __CLI Softwares__ : describes possible interactions for a given program type with a __CLI__
  - __dictionnary__ : describes technical words of expressions
