# Open Desktop Experience

This repository aims to describe ways we could be interacting with our computers, both through the desktop environments and through specific softwares.

In the end we believe this could be used by developers as a checklist of interactions to include for a specific program.

The repository is divided in 3 folders :
  - __desktop environment__ : describes possible interactions with the desktop environment
  - __GUI Softwares__ : describes possible interactions for a given program type with a __GUI__
  - __CLI Softwares__ : describes possible interactions for a given program type with a __CLI__
